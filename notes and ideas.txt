// Make typing exercises where it highlights text as you go along

Next thing to do:
CHECK        1. Complete the code to make typing the exercises work.
CHECK        2. Make an end condition for the exercise and a results display.
CHECK        3. Make a function to calculate typing speed
CHECK        4. Make a modal that pops up to confirm settings before beginning exercise
CHECK        6. Implement progress bar

CHECK  7. Make it so keyboard can only be turned on if screen is big enough
8. Make it so certain settings are disabled if they aren't relevant to exercise

I need to remember that for fill-in-the-blank exercises, the keyboard hints have to be off, otherwise they spoil the answers

I should have something where people can have to show the answers if they want

and accept answer as correct if they want
I need to figure out how to light things up when the user hits backspace

I should have several types of exercises, then give each exercise object a type,
then have a type object which has all the types and their respective rules

  Why learn Korean while typing?

  First and foremost, typing in Korean is a skill that you will need if you want to make use
  of computers and mobile devices effectively using Korean. Unlike the majority of languages, which
  make use of a keyboard layout similar to that of QWERTY, Korean uses a keyboard layout which is unique to the Korean language.
  This means that you will need practice building up your typing speed in Korean, as it is a completely separate skill
  from typing in English or other languages. By gaining confidence in your Korean typing speed, you will experience more
  success and less frustration when it comes to using the Korean for things such as online research, online shopping,
  making friends online, chatting in Korean, playing Korean games online, and so on.

  Typing in Korean is something that will feel awkward and frustrating at first. With a small amount of practice, however,
  your fingers will quickly remember the keyboard layout. From there, building up typing speed is merely a matter of practice.
  The more you type Korean every day, the quicker you will go. 

  Typing Korean also has an added benefit that it is an active skill. To type effectively in Korean, you have to pay close attention 
  to spelling conventions. Moving your fingers and actually typing the words helps you internalize the language on a deeper level. 
  There is often a large difference between a language learner's active and passive vocabularies in their target language.
  Challenging yourself by doing active learning exercises such as typing where you have to recall words and grammar from memory
  will expand your active vocabulary, and improve your overall proficiency and confidence in the language. 

  Corrected version:
  Typing in Korean is an essential skill for effectively using computers and mobile devices in the Korean language. 
  Unlike most languages that follow QWERTY layouts, Korean has its unique keyboard layout. This means you
  essentially have to learn how to type again from scratch.

Initially, typing in Korean may feel awkward and frustrating. However, with practice, your fingers will quickly adapt 
to the keyboard layout. Consistent daily practice will help you increase your typing speed. By gaining confidence in typing Korean, 
you will have more success and less frustration when using Korean for online research, shopping, socializing, gaming, and so on.

Typing in Korean has many additional benefits. Typing is an active skill which deepens your understanding of the language. 
Language learners often have a huge gap between active and passive vocabularies. By challlenging yourself to actively engage in typing exercises 
which require recalling words and grammar from memory, you can expand your active vocabulary, enhance overall proficiency, 
and boost confidence in the language. Not to mention, it will be great for your spelling.

1. Complete the code to make typing the exercises work.

// Plan
// Start a timer only when the user starts typing. Stop it when they get hit enter.
// As they type, each decomposed hangeul string should have spaces removed, and then
// the length of the characters for each exercise added on to a counter.
// At the end of the exercise, I will calculate characters per minute by simply dividing the time
// in minutes by the total of the counter.
